Answer to Question 3.10
the minimum number of blocks to travel is 38

the destinations along the shortest route is

[(6, 6), (9, 9), (7, 2), (5, 0), (3, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (0, 7), (6, 6)]

the shortest route to travel (block by block instruction) is

[[(6, 6), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8)],

[(9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 3)],

[(7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 1)],

[(5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1)],

[(3, 2), (2, 2)],

[(1, 2)],

[(1, 3), (1, 4)],

[(1, 5), (0, 5), (0, 6)],

[(0, 7), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6)]]

Finally back to (6, 6).
