
First, install Anaconda on your computer by following instructions here 
https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual/

Then create a virtual environment: 
open the Anaconda prompt (in Windows) or a terminal (in Mac or Linux). Execute the following command:

conda create -n MLA python==3.9.12

# activate the virtual environment

conda activate MLA

# install jupyter notebook

conda install notebook==6.4.8

# install the following packages

pip install matplotlib==3.5.2

pip install pandas==1.4.2

pip install imageio==2.16.2

pip install --user tensorflow==2.12.0

pip install scikit-learn==1.2.2

pip install gym==0.15.7

conda install -c conda-forge ghostscript==9.54.0

# If you want to play Atari games (starting from Chapter 18), you'll need to install the following packages:

conda install -c conda-forge atari_py==0.2.9

To install ROMS on your computer, go to the link below

http://www.atarimania.com/rom_collection_archive_atari_2600_roms.html

and download the file Roms.rar to your computer. 
Extract the two folders, ROMS and HC Roms, and place them in a folder on your computer. 
For example, I place them in C:\temp on my computer.

After that, run the following command in the Anaconda prompt (Windows) or a
terminal (MAC or Linux) with the virtual environment MLA activated:

python -m atari_py.import_roms <path to folder>

Since I saved the files in C:\temp on my computer, I ran:

python -m atari_py.import_roms C:\temp

Finally, you need the Baselines game wrapper for Atari games. 
Here are the steps to install Baselines:

• Step 1: Make sure you have Git installed on your computer; if not, see instructions via the link below 
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git.

• Step 2: Open the Anaconda prompt (Windows) or a terminal (MAC or Linux)
and activate the virtual environment MLA. 

Clone the OpenAI Baselines repository by running the following line of command:

git clone https://github.com/openai/baselines.git

• Step 3: Go into the baselines directory by running the following line of command:

cd baselines

• Step 4: Install the Baselines library in the virtual environment by running the following command:

pip install -e .

Make sure you don’t miss the dot at the end of the above command.
