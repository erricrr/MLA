# Machine Learning, Animated by CRC Press

<p>ChatGPT has kicked off an arms race in ML and AI. Everyone in every profession must adapt or face the risk of becoming obsolete. My book eases you into basic ML concepts and summarizes the learning process in three words: initialize, adjust and repeat. This is illustrated step by step with animation to show how machines learn: from initial parameter values to adjusting each step, to the final converged parameters and predictions. You'll learn how to build deep learning game strategies and combine this with reinforcement learning, witnessing AI achieve super-human performance in Atari games such as Breakout, Space Invaders, Seaquest, Pong, and Beam Rider. The book is published by <a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.1201/b23383/machine-learning-animated-mark-liu"  target="_blank">CRC Press.</a>
